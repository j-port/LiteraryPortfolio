                        <p>
                            Feminist literary criticism examines how literature represents and perpetuates gender inequalities, while also uncovering women's voices, experiences, and acts of resistance within patriarchal frameworks. This approach, developed through waves of feminist thought from Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler, investigates how texts construct femininity, masculinity, and power relations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Key questions feminist critics ask include: How are women portrayed in the text? What power dynamics exist between male and female characters? How does the text reinforce or challenge patriarchal structures? What agency do female characters exercise, and how is it constrained or enabled?

                        <p>
                            The tale of Cupid and Psyche, found within Apuleius's <em>The Golden Ass</em> (2nd century CE), tells of a mortal princess whose beauty rivals that of Venus. The jealous goddess commands her son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a monster, but Cupid himself falls in love with her instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Psyche is spirited away to Cupid's palace where she lives in luxury, visited by her invisible husband only at night with the strict condition that she must never look upon him. Encouraged by her jealous sisters, Psyche breaks this prohibition, causing Cupid to flee. Devastated, Psyche must undertake seemingly impossible tasks assigned by Venus to win back her divine husband.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tasks include sorting a mountain of mixed grains, obtaining golden fleece from violent sheep, fetching water from the Styx, and descending to the underworld to retrieve beauty from Proserpine. With supernatural assistance, Psyche completes all tasks and is eventually reunited with Cupid, made immortal, and welcomed among the gods.
                        </p>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
                        
                        <h3>The Politics of Beauty</h3>
                        <p>
                            From its opening, the tale reveals how female worth is measured by beauty, and how that beauty becomes simultaneously a blessing and a curse. Psyche's extraordinary beauty, praised by mortals to the neglect of Venus, demonstrates how women under patriarchy are valued primarily for appearance while also being punished for possessing what society demands of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Venus's jealousy represents not merely divine pettiness but the systemic competition patriarchy creates between women. Rather than solidarity, the beauty economy produces enmity. Psyche's sisters similarly embody this internalized patriarchy—their manipulation of Psyche stems from envy within a system that ranks women against each other.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Female Agency and Its Limits</h3>
                        <p>
                            Psyche's trajectory offers a complex picture of female agency. Initially passive—sacrificed by her father, transported to Cupid's palace, forbidden to see her husband—she exists as an object of male decisions and divine schemes. Yet her transgression of the prohibition to remain ignorant represents a crucial assertion of will: she claims the right to know, even at great cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The subsequent trials can be read as punitive—patriarchal systems punishing female curiosity and independence—but they also become occasions for Psyche's self-actualization. Each task she completes develops her capabilities, transforming her from passive princess to active agent who literally descends to the underworld and returns.
                        </p>

                        <div class="quote-block">
                            <p>"Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths."</p>
                            <cite>— Joseph Campbell</cite>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Structural Dependence on Male Power</h3>
                        <p>
                            A feminist critique must acknowledge, however, that Psyche's success depends upon male assistance. Ants sort the grain; a river-god advises her on the sheep; Jupiter's eagle fetches the Stygian water; a tower instructs her for the underworld journey. While Psyche perseveres, she cannot complete her trials through her own power alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This dependence reflects broader patriarchal structures where women's success requires male patronage. Even Psyche's ultimate reward—immortality and marriage to Cupid—reinstates her within patriarchal order as a wife. Her child will be named Voluptas (Pleasure), reducing Psyche's culminating achievement to the production of (male) pleasure.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Spaces of Female Resistance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yet within these constraints, feminist reading can locate resistance. Psyche's lighting of the lamp represents women claiming forbidden knowledge, choosing sight over blindness, truth over comfortable ignorance. Her willingness to undertake the trials demonstrates courage patriarchy would deny women possess. Her journey to the underworld—the most dangerous task—places her in the lineage of heroic descents previously reserved for male heroes.
                        </p>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            Feminist criticism reveals Cupid and Psyche as a text deeply embedded in patriarchal structures—valorizing female beauty while punishing it, celebrating female perseverance while making it dependent on male assistance. The tale simultaneously reinforces and subtly undermines the gender order of its time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Psyche's name means "soul," and feminist readers might find significance in this: the feminine as the seat of the soul's journey toward wholeness, even if that journey must navigate structures designed to constrain it. Her story remains resonant because women continue to navigate similar tensions between agency and constraint, punishment for knowledge-seeking, and the complex politics of beauty and worth.
                        </p>
