                        <p class="reflection-lead">
                            When I began this Great Books course, I approached literature as something to be decoded—a puzzle with a correct solution waiting to be discovered. I would read assigned texts searching for "the meaning," as if each story contained a single treasure buried beneath its surface, and my task was simply to excavate it. How different my understanding is now, at the journey's end.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The most transformative realization has been that literary meaning is not found but made. Each critical lens we studied didn't reveal something hidden in the text so much as create new possibilities for understanding. When I applied archetypal criticism, I suddenly saw patterns connecting modern stories to ancient myths. When I used feminist analysis, power dynamics previously invisible to me became glaringly apparent. The text hadn't changed; I had.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            This multiplicity was initially disorienting. If a text could mean different things depending on the approach, didn't that make literary study arbitrary? Gradually, I came to understand that this multiplicity is not weakness but strength. Just as we don't say that physics is invalid because it offers different explanations than biology for the same phenomenon, different critical approaches illuminate different dimensions of the literary experience. Together, they create understanding that no single approach could achieve alone.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have grown most in my capacity for what I might call "interpretive courage"—the willingness to propose readings that may not be obvious or universally accepted. Early in the course, I hesitated to venture beyond surface interpretations, afraid of being "wrong." Through practice and encouragement, I learned that thoughtful interpretation supported by textual evidence is never wrong, even if others might read differently.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            My writing has developed significantly. I learned to balance summary with analysis, to use quotations as evidence rather than decoration, and to structure arguments that build progressively toward insight. Most importantly, I learned to revise—to see first drafts not as finished products but as raw material for refinement. The analyses in this portfolio have been through multiple revisions, each making them clearer, more precise, and more compelling.

                            Each critical lens gave me new eyes. Feminist criticism taught me to see gender where I had seen only individual characters. Queer theory taught me to question categories I had assumed were natural. Psychoanalytic criticism taught me to look beneath surfaces for hidden motivations. I carry these eyes with me now, not just in reading literature but in understanding the world around me.

                        <p>
                            The greatest challenge was learning to sit with ambiguity. My earlier education had trained me to seek clear answers, to distinguish right from wrong, correct from incorrect. Literary analysis, I discovered, often ends not with resolution but with deeper questions. A text like "A Rose for Emily" doesn't yield a single correct interpretation—it remains productively ambiguous, inviting endless re-reading.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Learning to articulate my own responses was equally challenging. Reader-Response criticism seemed at first like permission to say anything, but I learned that genuine personal response requires careful attention to both text and self. What specifically in my experience shaped my reading? How might others with different experiences read differently? This self-reflexive dimension of literary study continues to challenge and reward me.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Working across cultures presented its own difficulties. Applying Western critical theories to texts from India or the Philippines raised questions about cultural appropriation and the limitations of any single theoretical framework. I learned to hold theory lightly—to use it as a tool while remaining aware of what it might miss or distort when applied to unfamiliar cultural contexts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am grateful for texts that challenged me—stories I might never have encountered on my own, from the nested tales of the Panchatantra to the spirit journeys of Philippine mythology. I am grateful for critical approaches that seemed intimidating at first but became illuminating tools. I am grateful for the patience to let understanding develop gradually, often emerging only in revision or class discussion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Most of all, I am grateful for the fundamental gift this course has given me: the ability to read deeply. Not every book deserves or requires such reading, but when I encounter one that does, I now have resources to engage it fully. I can identify patterns, question assumptions, analyze techniques, and explore unconscious dimensions that would previously have escaped my notice.
                        </p>

                            Moving forward, I hope to continue reading widely and deeply, applying what I've learned to new texts and new contexts. Literature has become not an academic requirement but a genuine source of pleasure and insight—a way of living more lives, seeing more worlds, and understanding more possibilities than my single existence could otherwise contain.
