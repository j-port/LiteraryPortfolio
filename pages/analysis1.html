                        <h2><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Critical Lens: Archetypal Criticism</h2>
                        <p>
                            Archetypal criticism, rooted in the work of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, examines literature through the lens of universal patterns and symbols that recur across cultures and time periods. These archetypes—the hero, the shadow, the mentor, the threshold—represent fundamental aspects of human experience embedded in our collective unconscious.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jung proposed that certain images and story patterns are inherited as part of our psychological makeup, transcending individual experience to tap into shared human understanding. Campbell further developed these ideas in "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," identifying the monomyth—a universal pattern underlying heroic narratives across all cultures.
                        </p>
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <p>
                                "The hero's journey is a pattern of narrative identified by Joseph Campbell that appears in drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. It describes the typical adventure of the archetype known as The Hero."
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Summary of the Text</h2>
                        <p>
                            The selected film/series follows the classic structure of the hero's journey, also known as the monomyth. The protagonist begins in their ordinary world, receives a call to adventure, crosses the threshold into the unknown, faces trials and meets allies, confronts the supreme ordeal, claims their reward, and returns transformed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This narrative arc has been the backbone of storytelling from ancient myths to contemporary cinema. The hero starts as an ordinary individual in a familiar setting, only to be disrupted by circumstances that demand they venture beyond their comfort zone. Along the way, they encounter mentors who provide wisdom, allies who assist in battles, and shadows who embody their greatest fears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The climax involves a death-and-rebirth motif—whether literal or symbolic—after which the hero emerges transformed, bearing the elixir or boon that will benefit their community. The return journey is as significant as the outward quest, for it tests whether the hero can integrate their new wisdom into ordinary life.

                        <h3>The Hero Archetype</h3>
                        <p>
                            Through the archetypal lens, we see how modern media continues to draw upon ancient narrative patterns. The hero archetype manifests not merely as a courageous figure but as an everyperson thrust into extraordinary circumstances, forced to confront both external adversaries and internal shadows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The protagonist's journey mirrors the psychological process of individuation that Jung described—the integration of various aspects of the self into a coherent whole. Each trial faced represents an encounter with disowned parts of the psyche, and each victory signals a step toward psychological wholeness.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Shadow Archetype</h3>
                        <p>
                            The shadow archetype proves particularly compelling in this analysis. The antagonist serves not merely as an obstacle but as a dark reflection of the hero's own potential—a vision of what they might become if they surrender to fear, ambition, or despair. This duality suggests that the hero's external quest is simultaneously an internal journey toward psychological integration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="quote-block">
                            <p>"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek."</p>
                            <cite>— Joseph Campbell</cite>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Threshold Guardians and Mentors</h3>
                        <p>
                            The mentor figure appears to offer guidance—wisdom that often proves insufficient when the hero must ultimately face their trial alone. This pattern reflects the human experience of learning: we can receive instruction from others, but wisdom must be earned through personal struggle. The mentor prepares but cannot accompany.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The threshold guardians encountered along the way test the hero's resolve and force growth. Each trial strips away aspects of the hero's former identity, preparing them for the transformation that awaits. The ultimate boon—whether physical object or spiritual insight—represents the culmination of this metamorphosis.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Universal Resonance</h3>
                        <p>
                            What makes archetypal patterns so enduring is their resonance with universal human experiences. We all face calls to adventure, cross thresholds into unknown territories, and must integrate our shadow aspects to become whole. Through the archetypal lens, popular entertainment becomes modern mythology, offering audiences the same psychological nourishment that ancient myths provided their communities.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
                    <div id="conclusion" class="analysis-section">
                        <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            The archetypal analysis reveals that contemporary narratives, despite their modern settings and special effects, participate in the same mythic tradition that has guided humanity since the earliest campfire stories. The hero's journey is not merely a narrative formula but a map of human psychological development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By recognizing these patterns, we understand why certain stories resonate so deeply across cultures and generations. They speak not just to our entertainment needs but to our deepest psychological and spiritual yearnings—the universal human desire to transcend limitations, confront shadows, and return transformed to share our wisdom with the world.
                        </p>
